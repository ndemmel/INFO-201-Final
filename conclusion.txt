Our data visualization aimed to answer the following questions of hate crimes:

1. Do the demographic factors of income inequality, education, and racial diversity each significantly influence the rate of hate crimes in a state?

2. Which state has the highest rate of hate crimes per 100,000 people?

3. Is there any correlation between the 2016 general election and a change in the average number of hate crimes per state?

The dataset we used from **FiveThirtyEight** (accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/hate-crimes)) was a collection of data from the following sources:

While our 3 visualizations; "2016 Elections," "Compare States" and "Demograohic Factors" revealed significant trends and correlations regarding hate crimes, we also need to be aware of some limitations.
- Correlations are not causations.  

*Just because there is a trend between 2 variables does not necessarily mean the 2 variables are directly related.*

The sheer number of factors that could potentially influence the rate of hate crimes in a country negates any sort of causal relationships that could
be derived from the data. Although the dataset was thorough in its inclusion of demographic data, there are many more reasons people would be more likely to commit hatecrimes than just lacking a high school diploma or belonging to the working class.

- Correlation Coefficients

To calculate the coefficients, we divided each of our variables of interest (Education, Racial Diversity, and Income Inequality) by the average number of hatecrimes per 100,000 people in a year. The numbers derived from this analysis represent each variable's closeness  the average rate of hatecrimes. 
- Reverse causality is not considered.  

*The relationship can also be a two-way relationship, with causality going both ways. This makes it harder to derive implications.*


Deriving policy implications just from our visualizations can be a bit tricky considering these limitations above. Instead, our hope is that our visualizations provoke the need for more actions, including further research, towards hate crimes.
