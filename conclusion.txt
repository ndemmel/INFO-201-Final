While our visualizations, _2016 Elections_, _Compare States_, and _Demographic Factors_, revealed significant trends and correlations regarding hate crimes, we also need to be aware of some limitations of the data.

<p class = "indented"> <b>2016 Election</b>
  <br>
    The 'Before 2016 Election' data was taken from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which gave the average annual hate crimes per 100K population for each state from __2010-15__. The data recorded in this program are crimes reported through law enforcement agencies. The 'After 2016 Election' data was taken from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which gave the number hate crimes per 100K for the __10 days__ after the 2016 Presidential Election (Nov. 9-18, 2016). However, the data recorded by this organization were of all reported crimes (prosecutable) and incidents (non-prosecutable) from citizens.
    <br><br>
    In this case, it is imperative to remember where the data is coming from when making conclusions. Consider the impact awareness bias may have on reporting after the election. Would the sentiments and results of the election cause citizens to overreport or underreport hate crimes or incidents?
  <br><br>
  <b>Demographic Factors</b>
  <br>
    To calculate the coefficients, we divided each of our variables of interest (Education, Racial Diversity, and Income Inequality) by the average number of hate crimes per 100,000 people in a year. The numbers derived from this analysis represent each variable's closeness to the average rate of hate crimes.

In addition, it is imperative to note that **correlation does not imply causation**. An observed trend between 2 variables does not necessarily mean the 2 variables are directly related. Especially since this is an extremely complex social situation, it would be an oversimplification to conclude that income inequality or level of education, for instance, have sole proportional impact on the rate of hate crimes in a state.

Deriving policy implications just from our visualizations can be a bit tricky considering these limitations above. Instead, our hope is that our visualizations provoke the need for further action, including further research, regarding how to reduce the number of hate crimes.
