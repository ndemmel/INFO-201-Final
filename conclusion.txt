Using a dataset on hate crimes and various demographic
factors available to us on
[git-hub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/hate-crimes),
our team aimed to answer the following questions through
our visualizations:

1. Is there any correlation between the 2016 presidential election and a change in the average number of hate crimes per state?

2. Which state has the highest rate of hate crimes per 100,000 people?

3. Is there any correlation between the 2016 general election and a change in the average number of hate crimes per state?

Our 3 visualizations, "2016 Elections", "Compare States" and "Demograohic Factors" revealed significant trends and correlations regariding hate crimes.
