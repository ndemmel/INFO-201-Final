While our 3 visualizations, _2016 Elections_, _Compare States_, and _Demographic Factors_ revealed significant trends and correlations regarding hate crimes, we also need to be aware of some limitations of the data.

Interactive Map Data:
The _Before 2016 Election_ data was taken from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which gave the average annual hate crimes per 100K population for each state from 2010-15. The data recorded in this program are crimes reported through law enforcement agencies. The _After 2016 Election_ data was taken from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which gave the number hate crimes per 100K for the 10 days after the 2016 Presidential Election (Nov. 9-18, 2016). However, the data recorded by this organization were of all reported crimes (prosecutable) and incidents (non-prosecutable) from citizens. It is extremely important to consider where the data is coming from, and

Demographic Factors Scatterplot:

In addition, it is imperative to note that **correlation does not imply causation**. An observed trend between 2 variables does not necessarily mean the 2 variables are directly related. Especially since this is an extremely complex social situation, it would be an oversimplification to conclude that income inequality or level of education, for instance, have sole proportional impact on the rate of hate crimes in a state.

Correlation Coefficients:

To calculate the coefficients, we divided each of our variables of interest (Education, Racial Diversity, and Income Inequality) by the average number of hatecrimes per 100,000 people in a year. The numbers derived from this analysis represent each variable's closeness to the average rate of hatecrimes. 

Deriving policy implications just from our visualizations can be a bit tricky considering these limitations above. Instead, our hope is that our visualizations provoke the need for further action, including further research, regarding how to reduce the number of hate crimes.
