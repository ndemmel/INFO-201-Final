While our visualizations in the _2016 Election Effect_, 
_Compare Crimes by State_, and _Demographic Factors_ tabs revealed significant
trends and correlations with regards to hate crimes, we also need to be aware of
some of the limitations of the data.

<p class = "indented">
  <br>
  <b>2016 Election</b>
  <br>
  The 'Before 2016 Election' data was taken from the FBI's Uniform Crime
  Reporting (UCR) Program, which gave the average annual number of hate crimes
  per a 100K population for each state from <i>2010-15</i>. The data recorded
  in this program are the crimes reported through law enforcement agencies. The
  'After 2016 Election' data was recorded by the Southern Poverty Law Center
  (SPLC), which gave the number hate crimes per 100K people for the
  <i>10 days</i> following the 2016 Presidential Election (Nov. 9-18, 2016).
  However, the data recorded by this organization were of all reported crimes
  (prosecutable) and incidents (non-prosecutable) from citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  In this case, it is imperative to remember where data is coming from when
  making conclusions. Consider the impact awareness bias may have on reporting
  after the election. Would the sentiments and results of the election cause
  citizens to overreport or underreport hate crimes or incidents?
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Demographic Factors</b>
  <br>
  To calculate the coefficients, we divided each of our variables of interest
  (Education, Racial Diversity, and Income Inequality) by the average number of
  hate crimes per 100,000 people in a year. The numbers derived from this
  analysis represent each variable's closeness to the average rate of hate
  crimes.

In addition, it is imperative to note that
**correlation does not imply causation**. An observed trend between two
variables does not necessarily mean the two variables are directly related.
Especially since this is an extremely complex social situation, it would be an
oversimplification to conclude that income inequality or level of education, for
instance, have sole proportional impact on the rate of hate crimes in a state.

Deriving policy implications just from our visualizations can be a bit tricky
considering these limitations above. Instead, our hope is that our
visualizations provoke the need for further action, including further research,
regarding how to reduce the number of hate crimes.
