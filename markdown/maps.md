The choropleth map above shows the distribution of reported hate crimes before and after the 2016 presidential election. It is important to focus on the shading, rather than the data values.

- Which states' rate of hate crimes increased the most after the election? Keep in mind, there may be other influential factors, as well.

While viewing these visualizations, it is important to note the source from which each set of data originated.
'Before 2016 Election' data was collected from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) between 2010-15 and consists of all reported prosecutable hate crimes. The original values were of the annual average number of hate crimes per 100K people. On the other hand, 'After 2016 Election' data was collected from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which is of all hate crimes, prosecutable and non-prosecutable incidents. However, the data from the SPLC is only of the number of hate crimes per 100K in the 10 days after the election. Thus, to make the sets comparable, we scaled the data values from the FBI down by 36.5.

In addition, as you will notice on the next tab, Washington DC was an outlier in the dataset. To keep the color scales consistent and significant, we removed this data point for choropleth maps.
