Our goals with working with this dataset are to bring awareness to the real-life impacts income inequality, level of education, and diversity have on individuals and our country's unity and wellbeing. We hope to educate the general public, while also encouraging those in positions of power to address these issues through legislation and advocacy.

We hope you will keep this motivation in mind while interacting with our application. There are a plethora of questions we could ask, however we decided to focus on the following three main questions:

1. Is there any correlation between the 2016 presidential election and a change in the average number of hate crimes per state?

2. Which state has the highest rate of hate crimes per 100,000 people?

3. Do the demographic factors of income inequality, education, and racial diversity each significantly influence the rate of hate crimes in a state?


Our visualizations aim to answer these questions in a creative and informative manner with regards to the format of the data found.

Thank you for visiting and please enjoy! We hope you learn as much as we did during this process!
