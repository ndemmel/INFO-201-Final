Welcome to our data visualization application on the connection between rate of hate crimes and various demographic factors. This data will be exploring the [Hate Crimes](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/hate-crimes) dataset from **FiveThirtyEight**, which is accessible on GitHub (more information regarding the dataset can be found under _Conclusion_).

Our goals with working with this dataset are to bring awareness to the real-life impacts income inequality, level of education, and diversity have on individuals and our country's unity and wellbeing. We hope to educate the general public, while also encouraging those in positions of power to address these issues through legislation and advocacy.

We hope you will keep this motivation in mind while interacting with our application. There are a plethora of questions we could ask, however we decided to focus on the following three main questions:

1. Do income inequality, education, and racial diversity each influence the rate of hate crimes in a state?

2. Which state has the highest rate of hate crimes per 100,000 people?

3. Is there any correlation between the 2016 general election and a change in the average number of hate crimes per state?

Our visualizations aim to answer these questions in a creative and informative manner with regards to the format of the data found.

Thank you for visiting and please enjoy! We hope you learn as much as we did during this process!
