The choropleth map above shows the distribution of reported hate crimes before 
and after the 2016 presidential election. It is important to focus on the 
shading over than the data values.

- Which states' number of hate crimes increased the most after the election? 
Keep in mind, there may be other influential factors, as well.

- Can you brainstorm any demographic factors that might be significant in the 
change in particular states?

- Did any states' shift surprise you? If so, research and see if you can find 
out why.

While viewing these visualizations, it is important to note the source from 
which each set of data originated. 'Before 2016 Election' data was collected 
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) between 2010-15 and consists of 
all reported prosecutable hate crimes. The original values were of the annual 
average number of hate crimes per 100K people. On the other hand, 'After 2016 
Election' data was collected from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which 
is of all hate crimes, prosecutable and non-prosecutable incidents. However, the
data from the SPLC is only of the number of hate crimes per 100K in the 10 days 
after the election. Thus, to make the sets comparable, we scaled the data values 
from the FBI down by 36.5.

In addition, as you will notice on the next tab, Washington DC was an outlier in 
the dataset. To keep the color scales consistent and significant, we removed 
this data point for choropleth maps.
