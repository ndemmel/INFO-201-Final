Using a dataset on hate crimes and various demographic
factors available to us on
[git-hub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/hate-crimes),
our team aimed to answer the following questions through
our visualizations:

1. Do income inequality, education, and racial diversity each influence the rate of hate crimes in a state?

2. Which state has the highest rate of hate crimes per 100,000 people?

3. Is there any correlation between the 2016 general election and a change in the average number of hate crimes per state?
